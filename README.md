Hello! My name is Erandi, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Mechatronics. My primary focus is on robot programming, particularly in motion planning, trajectory generation, and image processing.

I have a basic understanding of ROS 1 and ROS 2, and I am proficient in C++ and Python programming languages.
